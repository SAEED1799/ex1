Task 1
I used the hashmap <> as a data structure that can do me some 
operations in complexity O (1) and because in this task the graph
 changed us so that the side and its weight are also important and
 we have another value which is the weight of the side so I used 
the hashamp inside the hashamp and another separately so the hashmap
 The individual can give me back a certain vertex and its neighbors and
 the hashamp inside the ashmap can return my ribs also between a certain
 vertex and its neighbors ... I also did all kinds of functions with the
 help of the ashmap to maintain effective complexity and I also did an 
 auxiliary function called diyxtra So through this function I return the
 shortest route and within this algorithms I used getEDGE for each loop
 and so I could get to the shortest route between source and destination
